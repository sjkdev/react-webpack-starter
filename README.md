# React Babel Webpack Starter

> Starter with nav and routing set up -> react-router-dom, react-bootstrap
> Added [react-snap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snap) 

> Use when Nextjs, Gatsby or CRA seem too opinionated or bloated, feel free to swap out react-bootstrap for tailwind or whatever you like

> added react-helmet for meta tags to be assigned to each page
